    There are many data-types, including integer, float, array, string, etc. The string is the one we are interested in today. So, in this tutorial we will be looking into <strong>how to reverse a string in Python</strong> and find its solution.

      Now let’s start with understanding <strong>strings</strong>:<br><br>
    
    
    
    A group of letters or numbers is called a <strong>"string"</strong>.<br><br>
    
    Simply put, a <strong>character is a symbol</strong>. The English language has 26 characters, for instance.<br><br>
    
    Computers only work with numbers, not characters (binary). Even though characters may appear on your screen, they are actually stored and handled internally as a <strong>combination of 0s and 1s</strong>. <strong>Encoding</strong> is the process of changing a <strong>character into a number</strong>, and <strong>decoding</strong> is the opposite. One or two of the most widely used encodings are <strong>ASCII</strong> and <strong>Unicode</strong>. Python <strong>strings are made up of Unicode characters</strong>. Every character from every language is included in Unicode, which was created to bring encoding uniformity. Python Unicode is a resource for learning about Unicode.<br><br>
    
    
    
    Why should reversing Python strings be <strong>difficult</strong> once we've understood string?<br><br>
    
    
    
    In Python, strings are <strong>immutable</strong>, which means they <strong>cannot be altered</strong>. Unlike other objects, like lists, which we can easily reverse using built-in methods, this one is different. Instead of changing the original string to reverse it, we must <strong>create a new string</strong>. Given that this is a question that frequently appears in programming interviews, it is crucial to comprehend this idea. Even though you might not frequently run into this in your day-to-day programming endeavours, it's important to keep in mind. Let's get started by learning how to reverse a string in Python.

    <h3><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Using Loop</span><a id="sol" href="#why" style="color: blue">#</a></strong></h3>
     <pre><code><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">def using_loop(str):
        str_res =  ""
        for i in range(len(str)-1, -1, -1):
            str_res += str[i]
        return str_res
    </span></code></pre>
      <p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
    Above is the function. It takes a <strong>string</strong> passed as a parameter named <strong>str</strong>. Then  <strong>returns</strong> a <strong>reversed version</strong> of the string.
    <br><br>
    
    
    Let’s discuss its work flow:
    <br><br>
    
    
    
    Firstly, it, as told earlier, takes a parameter named <strong>str</strong> and inside the function starts with declaring a variable named <strong>str_res</strong>. Next, we run a loop from the <strong>last index</strong> of the string, which we find by the <strong>len</strong> function, to the very <strong>first one</strong> using the <strong>range</strong> function. And inside the loop, each element of the string gets <strong>concatenated</strong> to the new string named <strong>str_res</strong>, and because the loop ran in makes the reversed version of the original string and <strong>returns</strong> the new string which is <strong>str_res</strong>.

    <h3><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Using String Slicing</span><a id="sol" href="#why" style="color: blue">#</a></strong></h3>
       <pre><code><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">def using_slicing(str):
        return str[::-1]
    </span></code></pre>
      
    <p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
      Earlier, we saw the longer yet more conceptual approach being done. Let’s move to the shorter and easier approach. Now, considering you know <strong>string slicing</strong>, we are proceeding with the tutorial in case you don’t just <strong>refer to the FAQ below</strong>.
    <br><br>
    
    
    We slip, as earlier, a string as a parameter called <strong>str</strong>. Then we perform our operation, that is, we use <strong>string slicing</strong> to generate the <strong>reversed form</strong> and directly <strong>return</strong> it.

    <span class="faq-header">FAQ</span>
    <span class="faq-body">Using the character indices in a string, we can cut a piece from it. String slicing with indices uses the syntax string name [start index:end index: step size]. Here, "start index" is the character's index within the string where string slicing begins. The character in the string at which the slice of the string ends is indicated by the index value end index. The character at the end of the index will not be included in the sliced string because the end index is exclusive in this case. The indices in the original string that will be a part of the sliced string are chosen using step size. When the step size is 1, the slice will be made up of characters that run continuously from the start index to the end index-1 of the original string. With a step size of 2, we will create a slice of the original string starting at the start index and ending at the end index-1 using alternative characters. With a step size of 3, we will choose characters from the original string, starting at the start index and ending at the end index-1, while leaving 2 positions between each character that must be included in the sliced string. Slices are cut in reverse order if the start index is greater than the end index and the step size has a negative value.

    <p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">At the very end of this tutorial, let’s recap. A String an immutable datatype in Python. The first way involves running a loop in reverse and concatenating elements to a new one to get the result. In the second way, we simply use string slicing. I hope the information given here helps you in your journey of learning Python.</span></p></section>
