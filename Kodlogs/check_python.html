<p>In this tutorial, we will do something basic, that is <strong>How to check if python is installed</strong>. So, if you are a newbie in programming area and have been wondering where to start and want to figure out whether python is installed or need to be installed. So, there are few ways to do so including, <span style="color: #ff04fc;">searching for Python IDLE</span> or <span style="color: #ff04fc;">checking Python in Environment Variables</span>. Let's get into this with further details and see the basic ways to do the tasks successfully.</p>

<a id="what" class="custom_anchor"></a> <h2><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> <strong>Why we need Python to be Installed? (Explanation)</span> <a id="what" href="#what" style="color: blue">#</a></strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">To understand why we need Python, we need to understand Python first.<br><br>

Python is one of the famous programming language which gained its popularity in recent years. Python is currently the most well-liked high-level, versatile programming language. Python supports procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. Programmers type comparatively less, and the indentation requirement of the language ensures that their work is always readable. Python is a programming language that is used by almost all tech giants, including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber, and others. The vast standard library of Python, which can be used for : Learning Machines, GUI Programs (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. ), Django-style web frameworks (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox, processing images (like OpenCV, Pillow), Web mining (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium), testing frameworks, Multimedia, specialised computing, text processing, among other things.<br><br>

Now, above are the reasons for using python, so your need to install might be same or may be different. Now, let's see how to check whether installed or not.</span>

<h2><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Solution </span><a id="sol" href="#why" style="color: blue">#</a></strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We understood why to check Python is installed or why to even use Python in first place. Now, enough of the explanation lets get straight to the topic. </span></p>
  
<a id="sol1" class="custom_anchor"></a> 
<h3><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Searching for Python IDLE </span><a id="sol" href="#why" style="color: blue">#</a></strong></h3>
  
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Now, starting with a beginner friendly way. For that, we will be checking if IDLE is installed.</span></p>
  
<div class="div-faq">
<span class="faq-header">FAQ</span>
<span class="faq-body">An integrated development environment (IDE) for Python is called IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment).</span>
</div>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">This IDLE is installed when you installed Python in your PC. This is basically a simple and light editor for python programming often recommended to beginners due to simple interface and no auto correction.<br><br>

First solution, to find and check if its is present. That we do by searching it in cortana or start - search bar. This will give you the options and if it is present, Voila! it is Present in PC.
</p>
  
<div class="div-pink">
<span class="alert-header">Caution</span>
<span class="alert-body">Don't think Python is not installed right away if IDLE not found. Python named shell might be present which will also do.</span>
</div>

<a id="sol2" class="custom_anchor"></a> 
<h3><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Checking Python in Environment Variables </span><a id="sol" href="#why" style="color: blue">#</a></strong></h3>
  
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Now as we have seen the easier way, it can be also checked by checking Python in Environment Variables. This way tells you whether the Python is properly installed or not. <br><br>

To work with Python, you will need to call Python interpreterin different terminal, powershell or cmd. <br><br>
  
For this, just open Command Prompt or Powershell and write "python" and ENTER. If Python shell opens in the same window then, it's clear Python is properly installed. Else if, 'python' not found comes up its not properly installed.
  </p>
<div class="div-purple">
<span class="alert-header">Note</span>
<span class="alert-body">Sometimes, Python is installed but the Path is not present in Environment. But, in many cases you need to call the interpreter in different places, hence as mentioned its not properly installed.</span>
</div>
  <p></p>
  
<div class="div-green">
<span class="alert-header">Tip</span>
<span class="alert-body">Make sure to tick the option in ADD TO PATH in advanced option in Python Installer while Installing to make sure Python path gets added to Environment Variables.</span>
</div>
 
  <p></p>
  
<div class="div-faq">
<span class="faq-header">FAQ</span>
<span class="faq-body">If you know python interpreter is installed, yet not present in Environment Variables. Then just search for the Python directory or just open file location to get the folder location. Now, just simply copy the folder location and then search Environment Variables and there it will have option "Edit the system environment variables" and there just click option "Environment Variables" and there add the folder location copied in the Path option and paste there. Now, just restart the PC and just enjoy.</span>

<a id="con" class="custom_anchor"></a> <h2><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Conclusion </strong></span></h2>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As we have reached to the end of this article, now we have two ways of checking if Python is properly installed in the PC. First one, being the easier and beginner friendly and second being effective. Make sure to try both ways, to make sure you check successfully. At the end of this article, you have much information to check in a PC whether Python is properly installed or not and how can you fix it and can successfully start your journey in Python Programming.</span></p></section>
